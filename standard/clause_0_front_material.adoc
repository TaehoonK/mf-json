[big]*i.     Abstract*

This standard defines how to encode and share the various movements of geographic features by using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It provides an alternative encoding for OGC Moving Features instead of that provided in the XML Core [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/movingfeatures[OGC 14-083r2]] and Simple CSV [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/movingfeatures[OGC 14-084r2]] standards. A moving feature, for instance a vehicle or a pedestrian, contains a temporal geometry whose location continuously changes over time and dynamic non-spatial attributes whose values vary with time. This Moving Features JSON encoding defines a set of keywords to implement the conceptual schema of moving features defined in ISO 19141:2008 [ISO 19141:2008], accompanied with IETF GeoJSON Format [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7946.txt[IETF RFC 7946]].

In addition, this document provides an example of RESTful approaches as a OGC Web Feature Service that has the potential for simplicity, scalability, and resilience with respect to exchange of moving feature data across the Web.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This document specifies JSON encodings for the implementation of the conceptual schema of moving features defined in https://www.iso.org/standard/41445.html[ISO 19141:2008], i.e., features whose locations change over time. OGC Moving Features Encoding standards XML Core [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/movingfeatures[OGC 14-083r2]] and Simple CSV [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/movingfeaturesOGC[14-084r2]] have focused on the movement of 0-dimensional geometric primitives (Points), called trajectories. In addition, the ISO schema excludes deformation and changes of non-spatial attributes of the feature. However, there are requirements to represent and share the movements of 1-dimensional curve LineStrings, 2-dimensional surface Polygons, and 3-dimensional solid polyhedrons with time-varying non-spatial attributes in various application areas including: Location Based Services, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Disaster Risk Management Systems, and Smart City Applications. For example, the traffic congestion on roads and the hotspot of air pollution are typical moving features in the real world.

Therefore, OGC Moving Features JSON (MF-JSON) encodings define data members for one-parameter geometries and properties of the moving feature in time, not only trajectory. MF-JSON is inspired by the IETF GeoJSON Format [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7946.txt[IETF RFC 7946]].
