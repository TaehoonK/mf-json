==== TemporalGeometry Object
A TemporalGeometry object represents the movement of a moving feature, i.e., changes of the position.
Comparing to MF-JSON Trajectory, MF-JSON Prism provides an encoding rule for conceptual schemas specifying
prisms of the set of leaves (*MF_PrismGeometry* in ISO 19141) or trajectories (*MF_TemporalTrajectory* in ISO 19141).
The TemporalGeometry object is modeled as a mapping function from latexmath:[t\in time]
to a Geometry object latexmath:[g] of Point, LineString, Polygon, or GeometryCollection.

* A TemporalGeometry object is a JSON object that has at least three members with the name `"type"`, `"crs"`, and `"trs"` as shown in <<tgeometryjson>>.
* The value of the `"type"` member is one of string `"MovingPoint"`, `"MovingLineString"`, `"MovingPolygon"`, `"MovingPointCloud"`, and `"MovingGeometryCollection"`.
The TemporalGeometry object is spefified with additional members depending upon the value of the `"type"` member.
* The value of the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member is a JSON object to represent a CoordinateReferenceSystem (CRS) object (see <<crs>>).
If an object has no `"crs"` and `"trs"` member, then it may acquire the CRS instances of
the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member from upper-level braces of a JSON object.
If no CRS instance can be so acquired in a file, the TemporalGeometry object assumes the default CRSs (see <<defaultcrs>>).

===== 7.2.1.1. TemporalPrimitiveGeometry Object
A TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object describes the movement of a geographic feature whose
leaf geometry at a time instant is drawn by a primitive geometry such as a point, linestring, and polygon in the two- or three-dimensional spatial coordinate system,
or a point cloud in the three-dimensional spatial coordinate system.
The TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object is defined with additional members
named `"datetimes"`, `"coordinates"`, `"interpolation"`, `"base"`, and `"orientations"` as shown in <<tprimitivejson>>, as well as the common members in <<tgeometryjson>>.

/////////////
When a TemporalGeometry object has a `"type"` member with the value of
one of string `"MovingPoint"`, `"MovingLineString"`, `"MovingPolygon"`, and `"MovingPointCloud"`,
the object is specialized as a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object with.

* `"type"`: The `"type"` member is *mandatory* and its value is one of string
`"MovingPoint"`, `"MovingLineString"`, `"MovingPolygon"`, and `"MovingPointCloud"`.
The value specifies the type of a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object
for the interpretation of the array value of the "coordinates" member. Each type represents as follows:
+
[width="99%", cols="1,3a", options="header"]
|=========
| Types   |    Description
| MovingPoint |  The type represents a trajectory of a time-parametered 0-dimensional (0D) geometric primitive (Point),
representing a single position at a time position (instant) within its temporal domain.
Intuitively a temporal geometry of a continuous movement of point depicts a set of curves in a spatiotemporal domain.
It supports more complex movements of moving features, as well as linear movement like MF-JSON Trajectory.
For example, the non-linear movement information of people, vehicles, or hurricanes can
be shared as a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object with the `"MovingPoint"` type.
| MovingLineString | The type represents the prism of a time-parametered 1-dimensional (1D) geometric primitive (LineString),
whose leaf geometry at a time position is a 1D linear object in a particular period.
Intuitively a temporal geometry of a continuous movement of curve depicts a set of surfaces in a spatiotemporal domain.
For example, the movement information of weather fronts or traffic congestion on roads can be shared
as a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object with the `"MovingLineString"` type.
| MovingPolygon | The type represents the prism of a time-parametered 2-dimensional (2D) geometric primitive (Polygon),
whose leaf geometry at a time position is a 2D polygonal object in a particular period.
Intuitively a temporal geometry of a continuous movement of polygon depicts a set of volumes in a spatiotemporal domain.
For example, the changes of flooding areas or the movement information of air pollution can be shared as a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object with the `"MovingPolygon"` type.
| MovingPointCloud | The type represents the prism of a time-parametered point cloud whose leaf geometry at a time position is a set of points in a particular period.
Intuitively a temporal geometry of a continuous movement of point set depicts a set of curves in a spatiotemporal domain.
For example, the tacking information by using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) can be shared as a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object with the `"MovingPointCloud"` type.
|=========

* `"datetimes"`: The `"datetimes"` member is *mandatory*. Its value is a JSON array of
a sequence of monotonic increasing instants, having at least one element that is not `null`.
It does NOT allow a JSON `null` value. The expression of element instant is based on
its temporal coordinate reference system that is given by the `"trs"` member.

[NOTE]
==========
When the `"trs"` member has the default temporal CRS (i.e., ISO8601) object, an instant is generally as a a JSON string
encoded by https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt[IETF RFC 3339] or a numeric value of milliseconds since midnight (00:00 a.m.) on January 1, 1970 in UTC (e.g., `1465621816590`).
Here are some examples of instant.
-----
   YYYY (e.g., 1997)
   Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (e.g., 1997-07)
   Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 1997-07-16)
   Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30.450Z)
   where:
           YYYY = four-digit year
           MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
           DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
           hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
           mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
           ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
           s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
           TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
-----
==========

* `"coordinates"`: The `"coordinates"` member is *mandatory*. Its value is a JSON array of a sequence
of leaf geometries of a temporal geometry, having the same number of elements as `"datetimes"`. It does NOT allow a JSON `null` value nor an empty array.
Each leaf geometry corresponds to each instant element in the array value of `"datetimes"` in order.
The value expression of this member is different depending on the `"type"` value as follows:
+
[width="99%", cols="1,^5,4a", options="header"]
|=========
| Types   |      Formats of the `"coordinates"` value  |  _Comments_
| MovingPoint | [ [x1,y1(,z1)], [x2,y2(,z2)], ... ] | _a list of Point coordinates to construct a 0D leaf geometry (point) corresponding to each instant in order_
| MovingLineString | [ [[x11,y11(,z11)], [x12,y12(,z12)], ...], [[x21,y21(,z21)], [x22,y22(,z22)], ...], ... ] | _a list of LineString coordinate arrays to construct a 1D leaf geometry (linestring) corresponding to each instant in order_

coordinate arrays to construct a 2D leaf geometry (polygon) corresponding to each instant in order_
| MovingPointCloud | [ [[x11,y11,z11], [x12,y12,z12], ...], [[x21,y21,z21], [x22,y22,z22], ...], ... ] | _a list of MultiPoint 3D coordinate arrays to construct a set of points as a leaf geometry corresponding to each instant in order_
|=========

[NOTE]
==========
* A single position is represented by a JSON array of numbers, which must contain two or more elements corresponding to the order of axis of a spatial coordinate reference system.
When it refers to the default spatial CRS (i.e., WGS84), the first two elements are longitude/easting (x) and latitude/northing (y), precisely
in that order and using decimal numbers. Altitude/elevation (z) MAY be included as an optional third element.
* A Point coordinate is a single position.
* A LineString coordinate array is expressed as a JSON array of two or more single positions, allowing the same positions.
* A Polygon coordinate array is expressed as a JSON array of LinearRing coordinate arrays. A LinearRing is closed LineString with 4 or more single positions,
allowing the same positions. The first and last position is equivalent (they represent equivalent points).
For Polygons with multiple rings, the first must be the exterior ring and any others must be interior rings or holes.
* A MultiPoint 3D coordinate array is a JSON array of single positions with altitude/elevation (z).
==========

* `"interpolation"`: The `"interpolation"` member is default and the most important member
to represent various types of dynamic movements. Its value is a MotionCurve object that is described
by a case-sensitive string as one of predefined five motion curves (i.e., `"Discrete"`, `"Step"`, `"Linear"`, `"Quadratic"`, and `"Cubic"`) or
a URL (e.g., `"http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/prism/example/motioncurve"`).
The URL indicates a JSON document containing a user-defined curve of parametric motion
for the movement of a feature in two- or three-dimensional space.
The detail interpretation and representation of method is described in <<interpolation>>.
If the TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object has no member with the name `"interpolation"`,
it is interpreted by `"Linear"`.

* `"base"`: The `"base"` member is optional, and its value is a JSON object or a JSON `null` value.
The JSON object has two members: `"type"` and `"href"`. The `"type"` member has a JSON string to represent a 3D File format such as
STL<<STL>>, OBJ<<OBJ>>, PLY<<PLY>>, and glTF<<GLTF>>. The `"href"` member has a URL to address a 3D model data.
The 3D model represents a base geometry of a 3D rigid shape, and
the combination of the `"base"` and `"orientations"` members represents a 3D temporal geometry
of the MF_RigidTemporalGeometry type in ISO 19141. In MF-JSON Prism, the 3D model is transformed
into the fixed local coordinate reference system whose bound is *-0.5 to 0.5* for each axis concerning the right-handed local engineering coordinate reference system
and unit is *meter*. The origin of the local coordinate reference system is 0 for each axis and is transformed
into the centroid of each leaf geometry of a temporal geometry.

* `"orientations"`:  The `"orientations"` member is optional and always accompanied
with the `"base"` member. Its value is a JSON array as a sequence of transform matrices
for rotating and scaling of the base representation of a member named `"base"`,
having the same number of elements of the `"datetimes"` value.
It allows a JSON `null` value or an empty array
if and only if the `"base"` member has a JSON `null` value.
A transformation matrix is defined by a linear transformation
from the right-handed local engineering coordinate reference system
to the Cartesian coordinate system, such as the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system.
A coordinate of the base 3D model, latexmath:[(x, y, z)], transforms into a target 3D coordinate,
latexmath:[(x', y', z')], by using the quaternions and the scaling factors,
latexmath:[(x, y, z) \rightarrow (x', y', z')], as follows:

[latexmath]
+++++++++++
\begin{matrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  	x'\\  y'\\  z'\\ 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&
=
&
  \begin{bmatrix}
    S_x(1 - 2(Y^2+Z^2)) & 2S_y(XY + ZW) & 2S_z(XZ-YW) & 0 \\
    2S_x(XY - ZW) & S_y(1 - 2(X^2+Z^2)) & 2S_z(YZ+XW) & 0 \\
    2S_x(XZ + YW) & 2S_y(YZ - XW) & S_z(1 - 2(X^2+Y^2)) & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&
  \begin{bmatrix}
  	x\\ y\\ z\\ 1
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}
+++++++++++

The scaling factor takes the form of a vector latexmath:[S = <S_x, S_y, S_z>], where latexmath:[S_x], latexmath:[S_y] and latexmath:[S_z]
respectively is a coefficient against each axis to extend or shrink the base representation from the local engineer coordinate reference system
to the UTM system.
The quaternion takes the form of a vector latexmath:[Q = <X, Y, Z, W>], where latexmath:[X], latexmath:[Y] and latexmath:[Z] are coefficients
defining an axis of rotation in an imaginary spherical space surrounding the moving feature,
and latexmath:[W] is a scalar representation of the amount of rotation applied around the axis.
At this point it should be noted that the latexmath:[X], latexmath:[Y] and latexmath:[Z] components of a quaternion are not the same as the components
of a three-dimensional unit vector, nor is latexmath:[W] a direct representation of a rotation in degree.
To convert Euler angles to quaternion form, defining the angle around the X-axis (roll) as latexmath:[\psi], the Y-axis (pitch) as latexmath:[\theta], and the Z-axis (yaw) as latexmath:[\phi].
The quaternion latexmath:[Q] can then be calculated as follow:

[latexmath]
+++++++++++
[X = sin(\dfrac{\psi}{2})cos(\dfrac{\theta}{2})cos(\dfrac{\phi}{2}) - cos(\dfrac{\psi}{2})sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})sin(\dfrac{\phi}{2})]
+++++++++++
[latexmath]
+++++++++++
[Y = cos(\dfrac{\psi}{2})sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})cos(\dfrac{\phi}{2}) + sin(\dfrac{\psi}{2})cos(\dfrac{\theta}{2})sin(\dfrac{\phi}{2})]
+++++++++++
[latexmath]
+++++++++++
[Z = cos(\dfrac{\psi}{2})cos(\dfrac{\theta}{2})sin(\dfrac{\phi}{2}) - sin(\dfrac{\psi}{2})sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})cos(\dfrac{\phi}{2})]
+++++++++++
[latexmath]
+++++++++++
[W = cos(\dfrac{\psi}{2})cos(\dfrac{\theta}{2})cos(\dfrac{\phi}{2}) + sin(\dfrac{\psi}{2})sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})sin(\dfrac{\phi}{2})]
+++++++++++
