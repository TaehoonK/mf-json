=== MF-JSON Trajectory Encoding

MF-JSON Trajectory specifies how to map/interpret linear trajectories of moving points into/from the *GeoJSON* https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7946.txt[[IETF RFC 7946]] object.
It is based on the data model of _mf:MovingFeatures_ defined in http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-083r2/14-083r2.html[OGC Moving Features XML Core] [OGC 14-083r2].

[NOTE]
The _mf:MovingFeatures_ Class is implemented by _mf:Foliation_ including movements of moving points, which are instances of _mf:LinearTrajectory_.
In XML Core, the _mf:LinearTrajectory_ Class is expressed by a single spatiotemporal segment with linear interpolation, having two elements of _gml:PosList_ and _mf:Attr_,
as well as three attributes of _mfIdRef_, _start_, and _end_. The _mfIdRef_ attribute is the text specifying the moving feature (i.e. person ID, vehicle ID, etc.).
The _start_ and _end_ attribute of _mf:LinearTrajectory_ describes the temporal offset from the _gml:beginPosition_ element in the _mf:sTBoundedBy_ Class.
Two or more coordinate tuples are specified in _gml:posList_ and linearly interpolated from time _start_ to _end_.
The _mf:Attr_ element contains the attribute information as a text. The values of the attributes are constant while the feature moves along the _mf:LinearTrajectory_.
The detailed description refers to http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-083r2/14-083r2.html[OGC Moving Features XML Core][OGC 14-083r2].

Comparing to the segment-based encodings of http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-083r2/14-083r2.html[OGC XML Core] and http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-084r2/14-084r2.html[CSV],
MF-JSON Trajectory encodes a spatiotemporal linestring or a collection of linestrings to reduce the size of a GeoJSON document.
The spatiotemporal linestring is a one-dimensional object representing a sequence of spatiotemporal points and the trajectory segments connecting them.
The GeoJSON encoding rules of MF-JSON Trajectory are set as follows:

* An MF-JSON Trajectory document presents an instance of the _mf:LinearTrajectory_ Class or as a GeoJSON Feature or a set of those instances as a GeoJSON FeatureCollection object.
An _mf:LinearTrajectory_ instance is mapped into a GeoJSON Feature object with a linestring geometry;
i.e., the value of member `"type"` in the Geometry object is `"LineString"`.
[NOTE]
(GeoJSON) A Feature object represents a spatially bounded thing. A Feature object has, at least 3 members:
a "type" member with the value "Feature", a "geometry" member, and a "properties" member.
Geometry only has 2 members: "type" and "coordinates". The "type" value of geometry can
be one of "Point", "MultiPoint", "LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon", and "GeometryCollection".
The GeoJSON extensibility is limited by the interpretation of the sentence in the IETF RFC 7946
"Implementations MUST NOT extend the fixed set of GeoJSON types: FeatureCollection, Feature, Point, LineString, MultiPoint, Polygon,
MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection."

* The identifier of a moving feature (i.e., _mfIdRef_) is mapped into the member named `"id"` of the GeoJSON Feature object.
[NOTE]
(GeoJSON) If a Feature has a commonly used identifier, that identifier is included as a member of the Feature object with the name "id",
and the value of this member is either a JSON string or number.

* The value of the `"coordinates"` member of a linestring geometry object has two or more positions that draws a sequence of trajectory segments.
Each position is each projection in the spatial domain. All trajectory segments that have the same identifier are merged into a linestring geometry object
as long as any consecutive segments meet each other at a time instant.
[NOTE]
(GeoJSON) A position is an array of numbers. There MUST be two or more elements. The first two elements are longitude and latitude, or easting and northing,
precisely in that order and using decimal numbers. Altitude or elevation MAY be included as an optional third element.
The coordinate reference system for all GeoJSON coordinates is a geographic coordinate reference system, using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84)<<WGS84>> datum,
with longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees.

* The `"properties"` member of a GeoJSON Feature object has a member with the name `"datetimes"`. The value of the `"datetimes"` member is an array of a sequence of
monotonic increasing time instants, having the same number of positions of the `"coordinates"` member. The value of a time instant is a JSON string using Z (e.g., 1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z)
encoded by https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt[IETF RFC 3339], an Internet profile of the https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html[ISO 8601] standard
for representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar, or a numeric value of milliseconds since midnight (00:00 a.m.) on January 1, 1970 in UTC (e.g., 1465621816590).
[NOTE]
(GeoJSON) A Feature object has a member with the name "properties".  The value of the properties member is an object (any JSON object or a JSON null value).

* If a Feature has any variable attribute by time and its value (i.e., _mf:AttrDef_ and _mf:Attr_),
the attribute can be a member inside the `"properties"` member with the value of a JSON array, the size of its array can be distinguished into three types as below:
** The array of a time-varying attribute with step interpolation has elements with one less than the number of positions of the `"datetimes"` member.
** The array of a time-varying attribute with linear interpolation has elements with the same number of positions of the `"datetimes"` member.
** The array of a fixed attribute during the whole of `"datetimes"` has only one element.
[WARNING]
MF-JSON Trajectory considers that a member in the "properties" which has a JSON-array value is a temporal attribute.

* A set of _mf:LinearTrajectory_ instances is packed in the elements of the `"features"` member of a FeatureCollection object.
[NOTE]
(GeoJSON) A FeatureCollection object has a member with the name "features".  The value of "features" is a JSON array of Feature objects.
It is possible for this array to be empty.
