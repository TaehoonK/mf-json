|*Requirement 2.17* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE} |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/aggregation +
A TemporalAggregateGeometry object SHALL have at least two mandatory members of `"type"` and `"prisms"`.
The value of the `"type"` member SHALL be one of string "MultiMovingPoint", "MultiMovingLineString",
"MultiMovingPolygon", and "MovingGeometryCollection".
The value of the `"prisms"` member SHALL be a JSON array of a set of TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instances,
having at least one element in the array.

|*Requirement 2.18* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE} |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/aggregation/multimovingpoint +
A MultiMovingPoint object SHALL have the value of the `"type"` = `"MultiMovingPoint"`.
An element of the `"prisms"` member SHALL be a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instance of type `"MovingPoint"`.
The leaf geometry at a time position must be an instance of type `"MultiPoint"` of GeoJSON,
which is the union of each leaf of moving point members at the same time.

|*Requirement 2.19* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE} |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/aggregation/multimovinglinestring +
A MultiMovingLineString object SHALL have the value of the `"type"` = `"MultiMovingLineString"`.
An element of the `"prisms"` member SHALL be a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instance of type `"MovingLineString"`.
The leaf geometry at a time position must be an instance of type `"MultiLineString"` of GeoJSON,
which is the union of each leaf of moving linestring members at the same time.
{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|*Requirement 2.20* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE} |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/aggregation/multimovingpolygon +
A MultiMovingPolygon object SHALL have the value of the `"type"` = `"MultiMovingPolygon"`.
An element of the `"prisms"` member SHALL be a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instance of type `"MovingPolygon"`.
The leaf geometry at a time position must be an instance of type `"MultiPolygon"` of GeoJSON,
which is the union of each leaf of moving polygon members at the same time.
{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|*Requirement 2.21* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE} |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/aggregation/movinggeometrycollection +
A MovingGeometryCollection object SHALL the value of the `"type"` = `"MovingGeometryCollection"`.
Each element of `"prisms"` SHALL be a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instance with one of types of
`"MovingPoint"`, `"MovingLineString"`, `"MovingPolygon"`, and `"MovingPointCloud"`.
The leaf geometry at a time position must be an instance of type `"GeometryCollection"` of GeoJSON,
which is the union of each leaf of any temporal geometries at the same time.
{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
|*Requirement 2.22* {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE} |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/aggregation/crs +
The value of the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member SHALL be a JSON object to represent a CoordinateReferenceSystem (CRS) object.
If no CRS instance can be so acquired from upper-level braces of a JSON object,
the default spatial CRS (and temporal CRS) SHALL be applied.
