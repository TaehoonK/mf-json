A TemporalGeometry object SHALL have at least a mandatory member with the named `"type"` and its value SHALL be one of
string `"MovingPoint"`, `"MovingLineString"`, `"MovingPolygon"`, `"MovingPointCloud"`, and `"MovingGeometryCollection"`.
|*Requirement 2.5*  |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/crs +
A TemporalGeometry object has two default members: `"crs"` and `"trs"`. The value of the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member SHALL
be a JSON object to represent a CoordinateReferenceSystem (CRS) object.
If no CRS instance can be so acquired from upper-level braces of a JSON object, the default spatial and temporal CRS SHALL be applied for the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member, respectively.
