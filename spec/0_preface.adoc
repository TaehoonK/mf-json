[big]*i.     Abstract*

This document proposes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoding representation of movement of geographic features as an encoding extension of OGC Moving Features ([OGC 14-083r2] and [OGC 14-084r2]).
A moving feature, typically a vehicle and pedestrian, can be express as a temporal geometry whose location continuously changes over time and contains dynamic non-spatial attributes whose value varies with time.
It is Best Practice to share moving feature data based on JSON and GeoJSON (a JSON format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures). In addition, this document provides an example of RESTful approaches as a Feature Service Interface that has the potential for simplicity, scalability, and resilience to exchange moving feature data across the Web.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This best practice document basically follows the abstract data model defined in ISO 19141:2008 [ISO 19141:2008], and
the encoding method refers to the expression of IETF GeoJSON Format [IETF RFC 7946].
OGC Moving Features Encoding: XML Core [OGC 14 083r2] and Simple CSV [OGC 14 084r2] have focused on the movement of 0-dimensional geometric primitive (Point), called trajectories.
However, the draft format of this document covers the movements of 0-dimensional Point, 1-dimensional curve LineString, and 2-dimensional surface Polygon based on the application requirements such as disaster risk management, traffic information services, and geo-fencing services.
