|*Requirement 2.32* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature +
A MovingFeature object SHALL be a GeoJSON Feature object that have two mandatory members of `"type"` and `"temporalGeometry"`.
The value of the `"type"` member SHALL be a `"Feature"` string.
The value of the `"temporalGeometry"` member SHALL be a JSON object to represent a TemporalGeometry object, not allowing the JSON `null`.
|*Requirement 2.33* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature/temporalProperties +
The value of the `"temporalProperties"` member SHALL be a JSON array of TemporalProperties objects. It allows a JSON null value.
|*Requirement 2.34* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature/crs +
The value of the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member SHALL be a JSON object to represent a CoordinateReferenceSystem (CRS) object.
If no CRS instance can be so acquired in a file, the default spatial CRS (and temporal CRS) SHALL be applied to the object.
|*Requirement 2.35* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature/time +
The value of the `"time"` member SHALL be a JSON array to represent a LifeSpan object.
It SHALL be represented as a temporal domain to cover a temporal geometry or a collection of temporal geometries.
It allows a JSON null value.
|*Requirement 2.36* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature/bbox +
The value of the `"bbox"` member SHALL be a JSON array to represent a BoundingBox object.
It SHALL be represented as a spatial domain to cover a temporal geometry or a collection of temporal geometries.
It allows a JSON null value.
|*Requirement 2.37* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature/geometry +
The value of the `"geometry"` member SHALL be any JSON object or a JSON null value for the `"geometry"` member in a GeoJSON Feature object.
|*Requirement 2.38* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/feature/properties +
The value of the `"properties"` member SHALL be any JSON object or a JSON null value for the `"properties"` member in a GeoJSON Feature object.
