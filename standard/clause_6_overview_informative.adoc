== Overview of Moving Features JSON Encodings (Informative)

This document provides an alternative to the OGC(R) Moving Features Encodings XML Core http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-083r2/14-083r2.html[[OGC 14-083r2]]
and Simple Comma Separated Values (CSV) http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-084r2/14-084r2.html[[OGC 14-084r2]] standards
by using JSON objects that is easily readable by machines and by humans.
The JSON encoding formats for sharing moving feature data specified in this document leverages *IETF GeoJSON* https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7946.txt[[IETF RFC 7946]]
that has already been commonly used in many applications and well supported by tools and software libraries.
This standard defines two JSON encoding forms: *MF-JSON Trajectory* and *MF-JSON Prism*.
If an application focuses on only the linear movement (i.e., the spatiotemporal line string) of moving points
based on World Geodetic System 1984, with longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees,
the application can share the trajectory data by using *only* GeoJSON, called *MF-JSON Trajectory*.
For other cases, *MF-JSON Prism* can be used for expressing more complex movements of moving features.
*MF-JSON Prism* is an extension of GeoJSON formats reserving new members of JSON objects (`"temporalGeometry", "temporalProperties", "crs", "trs", "time"`, and etc.) as "foreign members"
to represent spatiotemporal geometries, variations of measure, coordinate reference systems, and the time interval of moving features in the GeoJSON document.
<<mf-encodings>> presents the overview of two forms of Moving Features JSON encodings.

[NOTE]
.Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
The IETF GeoJSON formatÂ recommends a single coordinate reference system based on World Geodetic System 1984, with longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees.
However, a moving feature needs a temporal coordinate system and may require an engineering coordinate reference system or parametric coordinate reference system
to represent the movement of the geometry of the feature in the case of an application request. Therefore, MF-JSON includes the "crs" field as described in GeoJSON:2008[4][[GEOJSON]].

TIP: The existing GeoJSON implementation can ignore the new members of "temporalGeometry", "temporalProperties", "trs", and "time" in an MF-JSON document
if there is no processing module for foreign members. Accordingly, MF-JSON is compatible with the IETF GeoJSON encoding.

<<mf-hurricane>> illustrates an example of the movement of a hurricane with a time-varying 2-dimensional geometry as a moving feature. Suppose the pressure centroid of the hurricane reported four locations
at latexmath:[t_1, t_2, t_3], and latexmath:[t_4]. Its trajectory may be drawn depending on the interpolation method between two consecutive locations, such as latexmath:[A] (linear) or latexmath:[B] (Quadratic).
https://www.iso.org/standard/41445.html[ISO 19141:2008] defines a conceptual schema of a moving feature based on geometry types as shown in <<mf-iso>>.
The ISO conceptual schema represents the motion consisting of translation and/or rotation of a moving feature, but not including deformation of the geometry, over time.

The data model defined in https://www.iso.org/standard/41445.html[ISO 19141:2008] is based on two geometric types: *MF_OneParamGeometry* and *MF_Trajectory*.
*MF_OneParamGeometry* is the type to describe a function latexmath:[f] from an interval latexmath:[t \in [a, b]] such that latexmath:[f(t)] is a geometry.
A leaf of a one parameter set of geometries is the geometry latexmath:[f(t)] at a particular value latexmath:[t] of the parameter.
*MF_Trajectory* describes a one-parameter geometry whose cross section is a point as a leaf.
*MF_OneParamGeometry* and *MF_Trajectory* is specialized as *MF_TemporalGeometry* and *MF_TemporalTrajectory* respectively, when the parameter is time representing a multiple of a single unit of measure
such as year, day, or second for those types. *MF_TemporalTrajectory* is also a sub-type of *MF_TemporalGeometry*.
The OGC Moving Features XML and CSV standard provide the encoding formats to represent linear trajectories of moving points, typically representing vehicles or pedestrians.
A sample data of OGC Moving Features XML and CSV encoding is provided in <<sampleXML>>.
