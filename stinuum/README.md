# Stinuum: A Visualization Tool for Moving Features JSON on Cesium

With the development of position tracking technologies and the increasing usage of mobile devices, various applications have taken a growing interest in the movements of objects and phenomena, such as pedestrians, vehicles, drones, and hurricanes. The historical location data of moving objects have brought new capabilities of free and open source software to manage and analyze big spatiotemporal data. In this talk, we introduce a new data format (MF-JSON) and interactive visualization tool (Stinuum) for handling moving-object data, not only spatiotemporal geometries but also dynamic thematic properties, by using Cesium, an open-source geovisualization platform. First, MF-JSON provides an alternative JSON format for encoding moving objects based on OGC Moving Features Encoding standards. In particular, MF-JSON covers the movements of 0-dimensional Point, 1-dimensional curve LineString, and 2-dimensional surface Polygon based on the application requirements such as disaster risk management, traffic information services, and geo-fencing services. Second, the Stinuum (Spatio-temporal continua on Cesium) visualization tool customizes the perspective view of Cesium for the continuum representation of spatiotemporal geometries in a space-time 3D cube whose x-axis and y-axis represent a geographic space and orthogonal z-axis (height) represents time. Comparing with a static 2D map with timelines and animated maps, the space-time cube visualization technique has advantages on the analysis of topological relationships among multiple moving objects.
