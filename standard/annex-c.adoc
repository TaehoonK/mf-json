== Deformation of Rigid Body (Informative)

If an application defines a wrong interpolation of motion, it brings unintended consequences. For example, the 2D triangle with a rigid body in <<deform>> has translational and rotational motion at the same time. It means when the application exports data with MF-JSON Prism, the application needs to define the `"base"` and `"orientations"` member as well as `"interpolation"` for a temporal geometry. If the application exports data without `"base"` and `"orientations"` value like <<mf-deform>>, the intermediate positions of the moving feature are interpolated with the linear interpolation function, as shown in <<deform>>. Even though the object has a rigid body, its boundary is deformed. <<deform-complex>> also shows the same phenomena that even the 2D polygon becomes 0D point in the middle time.
