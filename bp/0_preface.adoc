[big]*i.     Abstract*

This document proposes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoding representation of movement of geographic features as an encoding extension of OGC Moving Features ([OGC 14-083r2] and [OGC 14-084r2]).
A moving feature, typically a vehicle and pedestrian, can be expressed as a temporal geometry whose location continuously changes over time and contains dynamic non-spatial attributes whose values vary with time.
This Best Practice describes how to share moving feature data based on JSON and GeoJSON (a JSON format for encoding geographic data structures).
In addition, this document provides an example of RESTful approaches as a Feature Service Interface that has the potential for simplicity, scalability, and resilience with respect to exchange of moving feature data across the Web.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This Best Practice document follows the abstract data model defined in ISO 19141:2008 [ISO 19141:2008] with
the encoding method referring to the IETF GeoJSON Format [IETF RFC 7946].
OGC Moving Features Encoding standards XML Core [OGC 14 083r2] and Simple CSV [OGC 14 084r2] have focused on the movement of 0-dimensional geometric primitives (Points), called trajectories.
However, this document covers the movements of 0-dimensional Points, 1-dimensional curve LineStrings, and 2-dimensional surface Polygons to support application requirements such as disaster risk management, traffic information services, and geo-fencing services.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights.
