== Scope
This document defines the structure and content of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt[IETF RFC7159]] encoding implementation of the conceptual model
for moving features described in http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41445[ISO 19141:2008].
In common, a moving feature is a geographic feature whose location changes over time containing zero or more thematic attributes.
Such a feature may be a car, an airplane, a ship, or something alike.
The geometry of a moving feature to express its motion is defined as a one parameter set of geometries that may be viewed as a set of leaves or
a set of trajectories as shown in the <<mf-concept>>.
A leaf represents the geometry of the moving feature at a particular value of the parameter (e.g., a point in time) and
a trajectory is a curve that represents the path of a point in the geometry of the moving feature as it moves with respect to the parameter (e.g., time).

.Feature Movement: Trajectory, Leaf, Foliation, and Prism [ISO 19141:2008]

In the illustration above, a 2D rectangle moves, rotates, and shrink through time.
Each representation of the rectangle at a given time (e.g., latexmath:[t_1], latexmath:[t_2], and latexmath:[t_3]) is a leaf.
The path traced by each corner point of the rectangle (and by each of its other points) is a trajectory.
The set of points contained in all of the leaves, and in all of the trajectories, forms a prism.
The set of leaves also forms a foliation, meaning that there is a complete and separate representation of the geometry of the feature for each specific time.
If viewed in a 4 dimensional spatio-temporal coordinate system, the points on the feature's geometry at different times are different points.

This specification of Moving Features JSON (MF-JSON) encoding extends IETF GeoJSON Format [IETF RFC 7946] to describe two types of dynamic attribute of a feature
or feature collection in a JSON document as follows:

* _The spatial change over time (temporal geometry)_, representing the movement of the rigid or nonrigid body of a feature; and
* _The thematic change over time (temporal property)_, representing the variation of the value of any descriptive characteristic of a feature.

The MF-JSON encoding provides an alternative to the OGC(R) Moving Features Encodings XML [OGC 14 083r2] and Simple Comma Separated Values (CSV) [OGC 14 084r2] standards,
containing the movement of 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional geometric primitives. Also it can represent the following phenomena in a spatio-temporal
domain depending on the type of function from time to geometry:

* _Discrete phenomena_, which exist only on a set of instants, such as road accidents;
* _Stepwise phenomena_, where the changes of locations are abrupt at an instant, such as administrative boundaries;
* _Continuous phenomena_, whose locations move continuously for a period in time, such as vehicles, typhoons, or floods.

This specification does not address partial motions of parts of bodies and the dimensonal deformation of the feature (e.g., from 1-d geometry to 0-d geometry).
Also the succession of either features or their association is out of scope in this specification.
