2+|*Requirements Class: MF-JSON Trajectory*
2+|http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory
|Target type | JSON object
|Dependency |
* ISO 19141
* IETF RFC 3339
* IETF RFC 7946
|*Requirement 1.1*  |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/GeoJSON +
A MF-JSON Trajectory file SHALL contain a LinearTrajectory object or a set of LinearTrajectory objects
having a compliance with GeoJSON[IETF RFC 7946].
|*Requirement 1.2* |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/lineartrajectory +
A LinearTrajectory object SHALL be a GeoJSON Feature object that has two MANDATORY members of `"geometry"` and `"properties"`.
|*Requirement 1.3* |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/lineartrajectory/geometry +
The value of the `"geometry"` member SHALL be a LineString Geometry object, having `"type"` = `"LineString"`.
The number of elements in the array of the `"coordinates"` value in the Geometry object SHALL more than two positions.
|*Requirement 1.4* |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/lineartrajectory/propeties +
The value of the `"properties"` member SHALL be a GeoJSON object that has at least a member with the named `"datetimes"`.
The value of the `"datetimes"` member is a JSON array.
|*Requirement 1.5* |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/datetimes +
Each element in the array of the `"datetimes"` value SHALL be a instant object.
An instant object SHALL be only a JSON string to represent a timestamp encoded by the IETF RFC 3339 format using `Z` or
the numeric value of milliseconds since midnight (00:00 a.m.) on January 1, 1970, in UTC.
|*Requirement 1.6* |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/datetimes/monotonic +
The array of the `"datetimes"` value SHALL be a monotonic increasing sequence.
There SHALL be no instant object that has the same value as any other element.
|*Requirement 1.7* |http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/trajectory/constraints +
The number of elements in both arrays of the `"coordinates"` value and the `"datetimes"` value SHALL be equal.
