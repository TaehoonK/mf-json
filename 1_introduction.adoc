== Scope

This Best Practice provides a format for encoding moving features using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [IETF RFC7159] and an example of interfaces of the RESTful service of moving features.
The format defined this document is an alternative to the OGC(R) Moving Features Encodings: XML [OGC 14 083r2] and Simple Comma Separated Values (CSV) [OGC 14 084r2] standards.
Even though this document uses different terms from the expression in the OGC Moving Features Encodings ([OGC 14 083r2] and [OGC 14 084r2]),
Moving Feature JSON encoding basically refers to the abstract data model of moving features is defined in ISO 19141:2008 [ISO 19141:2008] as shown in <<conceptual_model>> with the concepts of foliation, prism, trajectory, and leaf.

.Conceptual Model of a Moving Feature: Foliation, Prism, Leaf, and Trajectory
image::moving-features.png[Conceptual Moving Feature, pdfwidth=60%, width=60%, align="center"]

In this illustration, a 2D rectangle moves and rotates. Each representation of the rectangle at a given time is a leaf.
The path traced by each corner point of the rectangle (and by each of its other points) is a trajectory.
The set of points contained in all of the leaves, and in all of the trajectories, forms a prism.
The set of leaves also forms a foliation, meaning that there is a complete and separate representation of the geometry of the feature for each specific time.
The prism of the moving feature can be viewed as a bundle of trajectories of points on the local engineering representation of the feature's geometry.

In general, Moving Feature JSON encoding applies to representations and formats of IETF GeoJSON [draft-ietf-geojson-04]; however, new terms are added to specify dynamic attributes of moving features:

* _Temporal geometric objects_ whose location changes over time: Movements of 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional geometric primitives, and their collections.
* _Dynamic non-spatial attributes_ whose value varies with time: Changes of a quantity.

This document also describes based on the data format:

* _RESTful APIs_ for handling moving feature data over HTTP: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

This version of this Best Practice document has left many issues out of its scope.
Design issues with complex interpolation methods and service capabilities were not considered.

== Terms and definitions

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r9], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards.
In particular:
- SHALL is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this specification, from which no deviation is permitted
- MAY is the verb form used to indicate an action permissible within the limits of this specification

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.
