|*Requirement 2.19* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/complex +
A TemporalComplexGeometry object SHALL have at least two mandatory members of `"type"` and `"prisms"`.
The value of the `"type"` member SHALL be a "MovingGeometryCollection" string.
The value of the `"prisms"` member SHALL be a JSON array of a set of TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instances,
having at least one element in the array.
|*Requirement 2.20* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/complex/movinggeometrycollection +
A MovingGeometryCollection object SHALL the value of the `"type"` = `"MovingGeometryCollection"`.
Each element of `"prisms"` SHALL be a TemporalPrimitiveGeometry instance with one of types of
`"MovingPoint"`, `"MovingLineString"`, `"MovingPolygon"`, and `"MovingPointCloud"`.
The leaf geometry at a time position must be an instance of type `"GeometryCollection"` of GeoJSON,
which is the union of each leaf of any temporal geometries at the same time.
|*Requirement 2.21* |
http://www.opengis.net/spec/movingfeatures/json/1.0/req/prism/tgeometry/complex/crs +
The value of the `"crs"` and `"trs"` member SHALL be a JSON object to represent a CoordinateReferenceSystem (CRS) object.
If no CRS instance can be so acquired from upper-level braces of a JSON object,
the default spatial CRS (and temporal CRS) SHALL be applied.
