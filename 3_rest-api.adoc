== RESTful API (Informative)

This Clause provides a design example of the RESTful API as a form of service interfaces to handle moving features on the Web with ease of development, access, robustness, and scalability in server/client distributed environments.
In general, Representational State Transfer (REST) focuses on resources and how to access to these resources over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
A few use cases of RESTful approaches for OGC web service interfaces are analyzed in the OGC Testbed 11 REST Interface Engineering Report [OGC 15-052r1].
Since OGC still consider a common guidance to define RESTful interfaces and JSON encodings, this work refers to the OGC SensorThings API [OGC 15-078r6], which provides a good example to follow the RESTful principle and is approved as official OGC standard.
However, this document contains a minimal description to implement RESTful API using the Moving Features JSON (MF-JSON) encoding.

=== General Information
Clients and servers exchange representations of resources via HTTP messages as shown in <<protocol>>.
Clients send a request against the resources to the server in the form of a request method, Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), protocol version, and request content (header and body).
The server replies with a response message consisting of the protocol version followed by a status code and content.

[#protocol,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Client/Server Communication based on RESTful API
image::protocol.png[Protocol, pdfwidth=100%, width=70%]

==== Verb

Verb is an HTTP method: POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELTE corresponding to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, respectively. A client make a request with one of the following method to be applied to the resource.

[width="99%", cols="2,8"]
|=========
|POST	| Creates a new resource.
|GET 	| Retrieves a resource.
|PUT		| Updates/Replaces an existing resource.
|PATCH	| Updates/Modifies an existing resource.
|DELETE	| Deletes a resource.
|=========

==== URI

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides a simple and extensible means for identifying a resource as being a locator, a name, or both. The general rules of URIs are defined in [IETF RFC 3986].
The RESTful API to support moving feature data uses a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for location and access of resources via the HTTP protocol. The basic components of URLs can be defined as follows:

======
*URL = _SERVICE_ROOT_ [ "/" _RESOURCE_PATH_ [ "?" _QUERY_OPTIONS_ ]]*
======

- _SERVICE_ROOT_: the identification of service endpoints for clients, usually formed as `"http:""//"host[":"port]["/"version]`. The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP
   protocol. The host is a domain name of a network host, or its IPv4 address as a set of four decimal digit groups separated by ".". The version is a API version.
- _RESOURCE_PATH_: the representation of a particular resource. By attaching the resource path after the service root URI, clients can address to different types of resources. (sub-clause <<resources>>).
- _QUERY_OPTIONS_: clients can apply query options after the resource path to further process the addressed resources, such as sorting by properties or filtering with criteria (sub-clause <<queries>>).

==== Version

The service implementation shall support a HTTP version. This document assumes the the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1" [IETF RFC 2616].

==== Status

The response message should contain a status code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request. Depending on the first digit of a 3-digit integer code, it is classified into five roles:
[width="99%", cols="2,8"]
|=========
|1xx	| Informational - Request received, continuing process
|2xx 	| Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted
|3xx	| Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the request
|4xx	| Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
|5xx	| Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
|=========

Full list of status codes are defined in [IETF RFC 2616], Section 10. This document suggests usages of the following specific codes:

- *200 OK* : General success status code.
- *201 CREATED*: Successful creation of resources for POST or PATCH.
- *204 NO CONTENT*: Successful operation for DELETE or PUT. There is nothing in the response body.
- *400 BAD REQUEST*: General error of client request, such as a wrong parameter, missing data, etc.
- *404 NOT FOUND*: The requested resource is not found.
- *406 Not Acceptable*: The media type given in the Content-Type header field is not `"application/geo+json"` or `"application/geo+json-seq"`.
- *500 Internal Service Error*: Unexpected condition during the request operations in a server side.
- *501 Not Implemented*: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.

==== Header

A general HTTP request/response message contains header fields consisting of a name, followed by a colon (":") and the field value. Detail information of HTTP header fields are also described in [IETF RFC 2616], Section 4.5 (General Header Fields), Section 5.3 (Request Header Fields), Section 6.2 (Response Header Fields), and Section 7.1 (Entity Header Fields).
The RESTful API of moving features in this document concerns only the Content-Type field, and the other fields are charged to the implementation of domain applications.

- *Content-Type*: All request/response message SHALL contain the Content-Type field to indicate the media type of the entity-body. The Content-Type field has one of media types of `"application/geo+json"` and `"application/geo+json-seq"` to interpret Moving Features JSON (MF-JSON) entities in the message body.
- *Transfer-Encoding*: A web server serves content as a stream (dynamically-generated content) with the Transfer-Encoding field set by `"chunked"`. The size of each chuck is sent right before the chuck itself, the representation of content is recommended to use the JSON Text Sequence format [IETF RFC 7464] for the streaming transfer. Content transfer is terminated by a final chunk of length zero.

[NOTE]
The Host request-header field specifies the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested. If the service_root omits the request, the client needs to include this field.

==== Body

The entity-body (if any) sent with an request or response is in the JSON format. If the entities represent moving feature data, it is encoded by MF-JSON. More examples are given the next sub-clause.

[#resources,reftext='7.2']
=== Resources
A request URI is constructed with a resource path for a corresponding resource item. Resources are the fundamental elements of the RESTful API. This API is designed by the resource classes and their relationships as shown in <<resource_type>>.

.REST Resource Classes of a Moving Feature Service
image::restresources.png[REST Resources, pdfwidth=100%, width=90%]

==== Resource Classes

- *MovingFeature Class*: It is for the root resource to enable the client to access other resources as its properties. A MovingFeature resource is *mandatory* to be implemented with the following properties in a moving-feature service:

[width="99%", cols="1,3,3,2,1", options="header"]
|===========================================================
|Name |Description | Data type | Multiplicity and use | Editable
|@id	| It is the unique and system-generated identifier. Clients cannot edit its value. | JSON Any (Null is not allowed)| One (mandatory) | NO
|temporalGeometry | A resource representing a temporal geometry. | JSON Object<TemporalGeometry> (Null is not allowed)|  One (mandatory) |YES
|temporalProperties | A resource containing temporal properties. | JSON Array<TemporalProperty> or Null | Zero-to-one | YES
|properties | A resource containing static properties as name-value pairs. | JSON Array<Property> or Null | Zero-to-one | YES
|===========================================================

- *TemporalGeometry Class*: It is for accessing the temporal geometry of moving features. A TemporalGeometry resource is *mandatory* to be implemented with the following properties in a moving-feature service:

[width="99%", cols="1,3,3,2,1", options="header"]
|===========================================================
|Name |Description | Data type | Multiplicity and use | Editable
|type	|Its value is one of "MovingPoint", "MovingLineString", "MovingPolygon", "MultiMovingPoint", "MultiMovingLineString", "MultiMovingPolygon", and "MovingGeometryCollection". | JSON String | One (mandatory) | NO
|coordinates | A collection of geometries represented by lists of sampled positions. | JSON Array<Geometry> (or Null for collection types)|  Zero-to-one (mandatory for simple types) | YES
|datetimes | A collection of datetimes when the coordinates are sampled. |  JSON Array<DateTime> (or Null for collection types)| Zero-to-one (mandatory for simple types) | YES
|members | A navigation property to address temporal-geometry elements of the collection types such as "MultiMovingPoint", "MultiMovingLineString", "MultiMovingPolygon", and "MovingGeometryCollection". |  TemporalGeometry (or Null for simple types)| Zero-to-many | NO
|interpolations| A navigation property to address the interpolation methods. | Interpolation (or Null for collection types)| Zero-to-many (mandatory for simple types) | YES
|===========================================================

- *TemporalProperty Class*: It is for accessing the temporal properties of moving features. A TemporalProperty resource is optional to be implemented in a moving-feature service. The minimum properties for the implementation are defined by:

[width="99%", cols="1,3,3,2,1", options="header"]
|===========================================================
|Name |Description | Data type | Multiplicity and use | Editable
|name	| A name of dynamic attribute of feature. | JSON String | One (mandatory) | YES (but, no duplication within a moving feature.)
|uom | A symbol or URI to address the unit of measurement. | JSON String or Null | Zero-to-one | YES
|values | A collection of sampled values to represent dynamic changes of feature attribute. | JSON Array<Number/String> | One (mandatory) | YES
|datetimes | A collection of datetimes when the values are sampled. | JSON Array<DateTime> | One (mandatory) | YES
|interpolations| A navigation property to address the interpolation methods. | Interpolation | One-to-many (mandatory) | YES
|===========================================================

- *Interpolation Class*: It is for accessing an interpolation method. An Interpolation resource is *mandatory* to be implemented with the following properties in a moving-feature service:

[width="99%", cols="1,3,3,2,1", options="header"]
|===========================================================
|Name |Description | Data type | Multiplicity and use | Editable
|@id	| It is the unique and system-generated identifier. | JSON Any | One (mandatory) | NO
|@name	| A name of interpolation. | JSON String | One (mandatory) | NO
|formulas | A collection of formulas to estimate arbitrary values at time. | JSON Any | Zero-to-one | NO
|===========================================================

For pre-defined methods such as Discrete, Stepwise, and Linear, the client cannot edit the names of methods.
This practice assumes that the name of a user-defined interpolation formula is automatically assigned by the service when moving features are inserted.

- *Property Class*: It is for accessing the static properties of moving features. A Property resource is optional to be implemented in a moving-feature service. The minimum properties for the implementation are defined by:

[width="99%", cols="1,3,3,2,1", options="header"]
|===========================================================
|Name |Description | Data type | Multiplicity and use | Editable
|name	| A name of feature attribute. | JSON String | One (mandatory) | YES (but, no duplication within a moving feature.)
|value | A value of feature attribute. | JSON Any | One (mandatory) | YES
|===========================================================

[NOTE]
JSON Any = False / Null / True / Object / Array / Number / String +
A resource instance whose type is specified, such as Geometry, DateTime, TemporalGeometry, TemporalProperty, Property, and so on, is a JSON Object.

- *FeatureLayer Class*: It is for a collection of moving features to manage data in a distinct (physical or logical) space; however, it is an optional resource and can be replaced by an Application-dependent feature.
When the service considers the implementation, the following properties may be required:

[width="99%", cols="1,3,2, 1, 3", options="header"]
|===========================================================
|Name		|Description | Data type | Multiplicity and use | Editable
|name	|A property indicates the label of a FeatureLayer resource | JSON String  | One (mandatory) | YES (but, no duplication.)
|description | A property describes a short comment about the layer | JSON String | One (mandatory) |YES
|updateFrequency | A property provides the connectivity of movement within a time interval (second) | Integer | One (mandatory) | YES (but, the previous data are not affected.)
|features | A navigation property to address each moving feature | MovingFeature | Zero-to-many | YES
|===========================================================

[NOTE]
The moving-feature service needs to manage the connectivity of features' movement by using the updateFrequency interval.

==== Resource Path Patterns

Each resource in the service has at least one URL.
The recommendation pattern of resource URL paths to address a collection of MovingFeature entities, a MovingFeature entity, and its properties will be formed as:
[source]
.URL patterns without a FeatureLayer resource
 - SERVICE_ROOT/MovingFeatures
 - SERVICE_ROOT/MovingFeatures(@id)
 - SERVICE_ROOT/MovingFeatures(@id)/temporalGeometry
 - SERVICE_ROOT/MovingFeatures(@id)/temporalProperties
 - SERVICE_ROOT/MovingFeatures(@id)/properties

[NOTE]
@id is the identifier of moving feature; therefore, the server needs to return its identifier when a client inserts a new feature or provide a way to access each identifier.


If the server implements the FeatureLayer resource, it is recommend that the path pattern of resource be formed as:
[source]
.URL patterns with FeatureLayer resources
 - SERVICE_ROOT/FeatureLayers/
 - SERVICE_ROOT/FeatureLayers($NAME)/features
 - SERVICE_ROOT/FeatureLayers($NAME)/features(@id)
 - SERVICE_ROOT/FeatureLayers($NAME)/features(@id)/temporalGeometry
 - SERVICE_ROOT/FeatureLayers($NAME)/features(@id)/temporalProperties
 - SERVICE_ROOT/FeatureLayers($NAME)/features(@id)/properties

[NOTE]
 $NAME is replaced by a string of layer name.

==== Resource Path Examples

A client can make a request against the resources via URL using various HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELTE.

=== Access Interfaces

The OGC Moving Feature Access [OGC 16-120r1] document requires three types of operations for accessing moving feature data: Type A, Type B, and Type C as follows:

- Type A: Retrieval of feature attribute +
For example, these operations retrieve positions, trajectories, and velocities of a moving feature such as a car, a person, a vessel, an aircraft, and a hurricane.
- Type B: Operations between one trajectory object and one or more geometry objects +
An example of these operations is “intersection” between a geometry object and a trajectory of a moving feature like a car, a person, a vessel, an aircraft, and a hurricane.
- Type C: Operations between two trajectory objects +
An example of these operations is to calculate a distance of the nearest approach of a trajectory to another trajectory. The case studies are distance between a criminal agent and a police agent for predicting crime patterns or distance between soccer players for making proper tactics.

OGC Moving Feature Access provides the implementation specification as a common design to support moving feature data into a database, data service, or an application using various programming languages or protocols (e.g., SQL, Java, and HTTP).
This sub-clause exemplifies how to realize those operations using RESTful API based on a resource URL, followed by the query option parts.
The client is able to retrieve a resource representation using a HTTP GET request.

======
"GET"  _SERVICE_ROOT_ "/" _RESOURCE_PATH_ "?" _QUERY_OPTIONS_  "HTTP/1.1"
======

This document basically follows the usage of query options ($filter, $count, $orderby, $skip, $top, $select, and $search) to be considered in OGC SensorThings API standard [OGC 15-078r6].
The OGC SensorThings API shows a good example of adaptation in OData protocols [OData-Part1] and extension of geospatial query functions.
This practice employs the `$select`, `$filter`, and `$search` options in moving feature operations.
In order to make a simple rule of the query options, the abstract operations of moving features as identified in [OGC 16-120r1] are re-categorized into three interfaces as shown in <<interfaces>>: *Harvest*, *Relation*, and *Analysis*.
Interface *GeoSpatial* and *Temporal* are additionally defined to access derived properties from a TemporalGeometry and TemporalProperty resource.

[WARNING]
The figure omits the information of parameters and return types of Type A, B, and C operations not to bring misunderstanding the OGC Moving Feature Access specification and ambiguous type definition. The detail specification of each operation in Type A, B, and C (gray color boxes) is described by the OGC Moving Feature Access.
The other interfaces (yellow color boxes) are not related to the OGC Moving Feature Access specification.

[#interfaces,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Interface Types of RESTful API
image::restinterfaces.png[Moving Feature Interfaces, pdfwidth=100%, width=100%]

- *Harvest Interface*: This interface mostly implements the Type A operations to retrieve feature attributes. The practice uses `geometryAtTime` and `timeAtGeometry` to extend the geometry types not only 0-dimensional geometry objects but also 1- and 2-dimensional geometry objects instead of _pointAtTime_ and _timeAtPoint_ in the specification.
In addition, operation `stBoundedBy` is added to return the boundary object containing moving features in a spatiotemporal domain.

- *Relation Interface*: This interface implements the topological relationship operations in Type B (between trajectory and geometry objects) and Type C (between two trajectory objects), such as _disjoint_ and _intersects_. The practice changes the name of _distanceWithin_ to `within` to exclude the distance parameter. Moreover, new relations of `enters`, `leaves`, and `passes` are defined to clarify its temporal order of topological changes of relation from _intersects_. +
<<relations>> shows the examples of each relation. +

[#relations,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']

image::mfrelations.png[Moving Feature Relations, pdfwidth=80%, width=50%]

- *Analysis Interface*: This interface implements the analysis operations in Type B (between trajectory and geometry objects) and Type C (between two trajectory objects), such as _nearestApproach_ and _difference_. The operations return a new object as a computation result. For example, operation "nearestApproach" with geometric object calculates the distance between a trajectory and the geometry or between two trajectories, and returns a distance in time. This practice additionally defines two more operations: `buffer` and `convoy`.
The `buffer` operation returns a temporal geometry (simple or collection) covering all points within a given distance from a target temporal geometry. The `convoy` operation returns a temporal geometry (simple or collection) covering a group of moving features such that these features are consecutively closed each other during a given time period.
<<analysis>> shows the result examples of `buffer` and `convoy` operations. +

[#analysis,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Examples of Analysis Operations
image::mfanalysis.png[Moving Feature Analysis, pdfwidth=100%, width=60%]

- *GeoSpatial Interface*: This interface provides function `dimension` that returns the maximum dimension of leaf geometry objects and `boundary` that returns the closure of the combinatorial geospatial boundary of all leaves (a foliation) for a temporal geometry resource.

- *Temporal Interface*: This interface provides function `snapshot` and `slice` that returns a sub-object of a temporal geometry/property at a given time instant and time period, respectively. The `boundedBy` function returns the temporal range covering its prism.

==== Query Option `$select`

The `$select` query option requests the service to harvest the properties or return a value derived from properties. The operations of Harvest, GeoSpatial, Temporal will be realized with the `$select` query option corresponding to a MovingFeature or FeatureLayer resource.

==== Query Option `$filter`

The `$filter` query option allows clients to filter a collection of moving features that are addressed by a request URL. It can be applied to a specific moving feature and a collection of moving features. The `$filter` option is evaluated for each moving features in the collection, and returns the features where the expression of the Relation interface is `true` in the response. For a specific feature, it returns `true` or `false`. The Relation interface will be realized with the `$filter` query option.

[NOTE]
The operations of Type C between two trajectory objects provide spatiotemporal relations (e.g., intersects); however, the current API excludes them from the implementation interfaces until the expression way for parameter moving features becomes clear in a request URL, such as the Well-Known Text (WKT) format for a geometry object.

==== Query Option `$search`

The `$search` query option allows clients to analyze moving features or a specific moving feature, and returns a new object as a computation result. The Analysis interface will be realized with the `$search` query option.

[NOTE]
==========
In the OData protocol, the `$search` query option is used to restrict the result to include only those entities matching the specified search expression. +
For example,

- pass:[<u>http://host/service/Products?$search=bike</u>] //return all Products that match the search term "bike"
- pass:[<u>http://host/service/Products?$search=(mountain OR bike) AND NOT clothing</u>] //return all Products that match either "mountain" or "bike" and do not match clothing
