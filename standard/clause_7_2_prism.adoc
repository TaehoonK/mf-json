=== MF-JSON Prism Encoding
This clause specifies the format of MF-JSON Prism to implement the package of Prism Geometry defined in http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41445[ISO 19141:2008] (<<mf-isoprism>>). The package contains five types used to describe the prism of a moving geometric object: *MF_PrismGeometry*, *MF_RigidTemporalGeometry*, *MF_LocalGeometry*, *MF_TemporalOrientation*, and *MF_RotationMatrix*. The type *MF_PrismGeometry* represents the movement of an object through geographic space. *MF_RigidTemporalGeometry* specializes *MF_PrismGeometry*, which in turn specializes *MF_TemporalGeometry* for the case of an object that moves without deformation, where the object’s basic shape is immutable and may be translated or rotated over time. The type *MF_LocalGeometry* is a geometric object to define the local geometry of the moving object in a engineering coordinate reference system (usually 3D). The engineering coordinate reference system is accessible through the Coordinate Reference System association inherited from GM_Object. The remaining types support description of the possible rotation of such an object.

The MF-JSON Prism encoding can represent the movement of *MF_PrismGeometry* and *MF_RigidTemporalGeometry* of a feature which may be 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D geometric primitives, or their aggregations. MF-JSON Prism reserves the following members as foreign members in a GeoJSON Feature object that represents a moving feature:

 * The `"temporalGeometry"` member describes a movement of a moving feature;

 * The `"temporalProperties"` member describes a set of dynamic non-spatial attributes and their time-dependent values of a moving feature;

 * The `"time"` member describes the life time of a moving feature;

 * The `"trs"` member describes a Temporal Coordinate Reference System object referred by time-expression to indicate the time of positions or attributes' values; and

 * The `"crs"` member describes a Spatial Coordinate Reference System object which relates the positions of features in the real world.

[NOTE]
.Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
The IETF GeoJSON format recommends a single coordinate reference system based on World Geodetic System 1984, with longitude and latitude units of decimal degrees. However, a moving feature needs a temporal coordinate system and may require an engineering/parametric coordinate reference system to represent the movement of the feature's geometry (positions) in the case of an application request.

A MF-JSON Prism document may contain JSON objects that represent instances with the following types, as well as primitives types of JSON null, true, false, string, number, and array.

* TemporalGeometry object (see <<tgeometry>>)

** TemporalPrimitiveGeometry object (see <<tprimitive>>)

** TemporalComplexGeometry object (see <<tcomplex>>)

* TemporalProperties object (see <<tproperties>>)

** ParametricValues object (see <<pvalues>>)

* CoordinateReferenceSystem object (see <<crs>>)

* MovingFeature object (see <<mfeature>>)
* MovingFeatureCollection object (see <<mfeaturecollection>>)

* LifeSpan object (see <<time>>)

* BoundingBox object (see <<bbox>>)

* Geometry object (see <<geometry>>)

* Properties object (see <<properties>>)

* MotionCurve object (see <<interpolation>>)

The schema of MF-JSON Prism is depicted by a UML diagram as shown in <<mf-prism-uml>>.

When a document combines two formats of MF-JSON Prism and MF-JSON Trajectory, MF-JSON Prism has priority to interpret the movement of a feature. A sample data of MF-JSON Prism is provided in <<sampleJSONPrism>>.
